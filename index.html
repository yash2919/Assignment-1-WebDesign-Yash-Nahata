<h1>Movie History</h1>
<p>Movie history is a vast and fascinating subject that encompasses the evolution of cinema from its earliest beginnings to the modern era. Here's a brief overview of key milestones and developments in the history of movies:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>The Invention of Cinema (Late 19th Century):</b> The birth of cinema is often attributed to inventors like Thomas Edison, the Lumière brothers (Auguste and Louis Lumière), and Georges Méliès. They experimented with motion pictures, leading to the first public screening of films in the late 19th century.</li>
 <br> <li><b>Silent Era (1890s-1920s):</b> During the silent film era, movies were characterized by their lack of synchronized sound. Silent films used intertitles and live musical accompaniment to convey dialogue and emotions. Pioneering filmmakers like D.W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin rose to prominence during this period.</li>
 <br> <li><b>The Transition to Sound (1920s-1930s):</b> The introduction of synchronized sound, known as "talkies," revolutionized the film industry. Warner Bros.' "The Jazz Singer" (1927) is often credited as the first feature-length sound film. This transition marked the end of the silent era.</li>
<br><li><b>Golden Age of Hollywood (1930s-1950s):</b> Hollywood became the epicenter of the global film industry, producing iconic films and stars. The studio system dominated, with major studios like MGM and Warner Bros. leading the way.</li>
 <br> <li><b>Modern Era and Digital Revolution (2000s-Present):</b> The 21st century brought a digital revolution to filmmaking, with advancements in CGI and digital distribution. Streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ disrupted traditional distribution, shaping the modern film landscape.</li>
